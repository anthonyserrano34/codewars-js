# Codewars JavaScript Solutions

Welcome to my repository of my [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) solutions.
Each solution is written in JavaScript and is organized by the challenge name and their categories (kyu).

## Structure

The solutions are organized in the following structure:

```
/*kyu
	/<challenge-name>
		- main.js
		- README.md
```

Each challenge has its own folder containing the solution file and a README file with a description of the challenge.
